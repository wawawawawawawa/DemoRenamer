# Alien Swarm DemoRenamer

This tool will allow you to automaticly sort recording of your games in a few clicks!

Download and Extract the files, then Run DemoRenamer.exe (or .ahk if you have AutoHotkey installed).

1) You will be asked the demos folder.

Every sub-folder will be checked for any .dem file starting by "asrd"

2) You will be asked the folder to sort the demo into.

3) The tool will then sort them by Date/Server

   Each file will be moved to the (folder selected)/Day/Server/

4) The tool will then rename them into asrd_(Date)-(Day)_(MapName)

Only files starting with "asrd" will be moved/renamed (the [autorecord tool](https://github.com/wawawawawawawa/Alien-Swarm-AutoRecord) automatically name them asrd_X).
