# Alien Swarm DemoRenamer

This tool will allow you to automaticly sort recording of your games in a few clicks!

Download and Extract the files, then Run DemoRenamer.exe (or .ahk if you have [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) installed).

**1) You will be asked the demos folder (usually the game directory\reactivedrop\).**

Choose if you want every sub-folder to be checked for any .dem file starting by "asrd"

**2) You will be asked the folder to sort the demo into.**

The tool will then sort them by Date/Server and rename them into asrd_(Date)-(Time)_(MapName)

Each file will be moved to the (folder selected)/Day/Server/

Server is actually an IP adress

Only files starting with "asrd" will be moved/renamed (the [autorecord tool](https://github.com/wawawawawawawa/Alien-Swarm-AutoRecord) automatically name them asrd_X).
